# exception-quotient
In this program, I take a simple division of two integers and handle any possible exceptions that may occur.
I created a class called "QuotientWithException" where it calculates the division and throws
an ArithmeticException if the divisor is 0. An additional existing exception called "InputMismatchException"
handles the incorrect input by the user. For example, if a user enters a character or a string, the exception
is thrown and caught and the loop allows user to re-enter inputs and try again.
